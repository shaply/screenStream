# screenStream

## Description
Personal project where I create a streaming website/service

### First attempt: Branch "Continuos-jpeg-transmissions-with-flask"
I tried to accomplish this task with flask and continuous screenshots. I created a class that continuously takes screenshots, saves them as jpegs, and then sends the images to the website.
